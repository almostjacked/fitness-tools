## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ee38e0d: Add FFMI and RSMI body-composition calculators.

  - `ffmi` — Fat-Free Mass Index: raw and height-adjusted FFMI from weight and body fat (or lean mass), with a natural-limit flag (compared against the height-normalized value).
  - `rsmi` — Relative Skeletal Muscle Index: from a DXA value (`direct`) and/or an anthropometric estimate (`wen-2011`), flagged against EWGSOP2, AWGS, and Baumgartner sarcopenia cutoffs.

  Additive only — no existing calculator outputs change. Both tools are exposed over the MCP server as well.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ee38e0d]
  - @almostjacked/fitness-tools@0.2.0

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0414680: Fix the broken 0.1.0 release. That version was published with `npm publish`, which
  ships `workspace:*` dependency ranges verbatim, so `npx @almostjacked/fitness-tools-mcp`
  failed with `Unsupported URL Type "workspace:"` (EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL) and the MCP
  server never started. Republishing through the pnpm/changesets pipeline resolves the
  `@almostjacked/fitness-tools` dependency to a concrete version. A `prepublishOnly`
  guard now blocks accidental `npm publish` of workspace packages to prevent a recurrence.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e605961: Add `@almostjacked/fitness-tools-mcp`: an MCP stdio server exposing the fitness
  calculators as MCP tools (one per calculator), with structured output and a JSON
  text fallback. Runnable via `npx @almostjacked/fitness-tools-mcp`.
